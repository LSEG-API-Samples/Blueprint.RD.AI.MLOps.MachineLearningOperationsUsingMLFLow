# Machine Learning Operations - MLFLow automated logging


## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
MLFLow is an open source MLOps tool that can be used to deliver enterprise level tracking and productionisation of AI systems. While MLFlow is fully compatible with deployments on the cloud we will be presenting a localhost flow using MLFlow automated tracking, Projects, Models and Registry. These components can be either used on an isolated basis or as a framework able to productionise an end-to-end MLOps process.
